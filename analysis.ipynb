house i have in mind  i was going for a simple\\nfarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near wimberley\\n\\na few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:\\n\\nthere will be a double porch across the back just like the front\\nno dormers (metal roof)\\n1/2 bath under stairs\\noverall dimensions are 55 by 40\\n\\n\\nwhat i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen  more\\ncabinets maybe a different shaped island and a way to enlarge the pantry\\nreagan\\nsuggested that i find a way to make the exterior more attractive  i want\\nto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks but i was thinking about\\nbringing the left\\nside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front\\nthat might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco  also the front\\nporch would\\nbe smaller\\n\\ni have 3 bids from builders all around $325000  i am ready to go ahead\\nand have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose a\\nbuilder\\ni just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work  as i mentioned\\nmy alternative is $060/ft  i thought that since i had a such a detailed\\nsketch you might consider the job for less than the $6000 that reagan\\nallowed\\n\\nphillip allen\\n713-853-7041\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/29/2001\\n09:10 am

scholtes/hou/ect@ect \\nsubject: caiso demand reduction\\n\\nphillip et al\\n\\ni have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in \\nthe west  your intuition as to reductions seen so far (eg march 2001 vs \\nmarch 2000) was absolutely correct  at this point it appears that demand \\nover the last 12 months in the caiso control area after adjusting for \\ntemperature and time of use factors has fallen by about 6%  this translates \\ninto a reduction of about 1500-1600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as \\ncompared with the previous year\\n\\nlooking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary \\nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts)  other \\nforecasters (eg pira) are estimating that another 1200-1300 mwa (making \\ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2700-2800) will come off starting in june  \\nthis scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple \\nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand  given that the 6% \\ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\nretail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it \\nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\nyear  this would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3300-3500 mwa in \\njun-aug  in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\nare being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of \\nmeeting and perhaps exceeding the 3500 mwa figure  finally the general \\neconomic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least \\nmake the 3500 mwa number that much more attainable\\n\\nnote that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area \\nonly which represents about 89% of total calif load or 36-37% of wscc \\n(us) summer load  i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso \\nportion of calif (ie ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in \\ndemand  as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call  as \\nyou are aware the pacific nw has already seen about 2000 mwa of aluminum \\nsmelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at \\nleast through sep and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its \\nwish)  this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc  several \\nmining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are \\nsharply curtailing production  i have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\nhow many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue  \\nother large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from calif\\'s \\neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west  while the rest of \\nthe wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif i \\nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\nrealized) or approx 1000-1500 mwa of further demand reduction in the \\nnon-calif wscc for this summer  this would bring the total reduction for the \\nwscc including the 2000 mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around \\n6500-7000 mwa when compared with last summer\\n\\ni am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you \\nwith updates as new or better information becomes available  meantime i \\nhope this helps  please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\nquestions or need any further information\\n', 'jeff'], ['phillip.allen@enron.com',

  in 1997 a little-known silicon valley company called exodus\\n                  communications opened a 15000-square-foot data center in \\ntukwila \\n\\n                       the mission was to handle the internet traffic and \\ncomputer servers for the\\n                  region\\'s growing number of dot-coms \\n\\n                       fast-forward to summer 2000 exodus is now wrapping up \\nconstruction\\n                  on a new 13-acre 576000-square-foot data center less than \\na mile from its\\n                  original facility sitting at the confluence of several \\nfiber optic backbones the\\n                  exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\neventually\\n                  house internet servers for firms such as avenue a \\nmicrosoft and onviacom \\n\\n                       exodus is not the only company building massive data \\ncenters near seattle\\n                  more than a dozen companies -- with names like abovenet \\nglobix and\\n                  hostpro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\nthe networking\\n                  equipment of the internet economy \\n\\n                       it is a big business that could have an effect on \\neverything from your\\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\nyour favorite web sites\\n\\n                       data centers also known as co-location facilities and \\nserver farms are\\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent \\nvalley that some\\n                  have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and \\npuget sound\\n                  energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour \\nhigh-security\\n                  facilities \\n\\n

washington \\nutilities and\\n                  transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new \\ndata centers the\\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\nresidential and business\\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\nnecessary to support\\n                  the projects those base stations could cost as

complex issue \\n\\n                       on one hand the data centers -- with their amazing \\nappetite for power --\\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers the \\nfacilities run 24 hours a\\n                  day seven days a week and therefore could become a \\nconstant revenue\\n                  stream on the other hand they require so much energy that \\nthey could\\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\nexpenditures \\n\\n                       who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\nmean for

all so this may not be \\nan issue but i'll point it out and let you decide  let me know if this is \\nok as is so i'll know to ignore it in the future  also if you want me to \\nget with kim and the sitara people to change the mapping let me know and \\ni'll take care of it\\n\\non pg&e nw it appears that pgen kingsgate is mapped to a malin citygate \\ncurve instead of a kingsgate curve resulting in a total transport loss of \\n$235019   \\n(if the mapping were changed it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\noverall p&l)  maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\nsomething else somewhere that i am not seeing but anyway here are the deal \\n#'s paths and p&l impacts of each\\n  139195  from kingsgate to malin     ($182030)\\n  139196 from kingsgate to

suggested fix:  change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp-malin citygate to \\ngdp-kingsgate\\n\\n clay basin storage--this is really a fyi more than anything else--i see five \\ndifferent tickets in sitara for clay basin activity--one appears to be for \\nwithdrawals and the other four are injections  clay basin is valued as a \\nquestar curve which is substantially below nwpl points  what this means is \\nthat any time you are injecting gas these tickets will show transport \\nlosses; each time you are withdrawing you will show big gains on transport  \\ni'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\nsystematic sitara way of handling storage deals  in an ideal world it seems \\nthat you would map it the way you have it today but during injection times \\nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs  anyway here's the \\ndetail on the tickets just for your info plus i noticed three days where it \\nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin  there may be \\nan operational reason why this occurred that i'm not aware of and the dollar \\nimpact is very small but i thought i'd bring it to your attention just in

are ultimately our best sources  for your purposes \\nthe caiso may suffice  i think that you probably know this already but \\nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\ngeneration  you are pulling \"scheduled\"  if someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\ngeneration and then generates either instructed or uninstructed then you \\nwill miss that  you may also miss generation of the northern california \\nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso  that is \\nif they have 1500 mw of load and 1200 mw of generation they may simply \\nschedule 300 mw of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 mw  having said \\nall of that it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\nthe generation side\\n\\non the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load  while \\nthey don\\'t split out np15 from sp15 i think that using the actual number is \\nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number  the utilities play lots of game on the \\nload side usually under-scheduling depending on price\\n\\ni think the presentation looks good  it would be useful to share this with \\nothers up here once you have it

receipt of all the requested information regarding the\\nproject we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market  there are a\\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the bank moving forward\\non the transaction  first the pro-forma rental rates when compared on a\\nbedroom to bedroom basis are high relative to the market   we adjusted\\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\\nacheiving on the existing sagewood project  additionally there are about \\n500+\\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the city of san marcos \\nthis\\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\\neffect on an over leveraged project  we have therefore adjusted the requested\\nloan amount to $8868000\\n\\ni have summarized our issues as follows:\\n\\n1  pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\\n\\n     pro-forma                           bank\\'s adjustment\\n

$417\\n\\n2  pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\\nturn over\\n\\n3  a market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to potential gross income (pgi)\\n\\n4  based on the bank\\'s revised noi of $1075000 the project can support\\ndebt in the amount of $8868000 and maintain our loan parameters of 125x \\ndebt\\ncoverage ratio on a 25 year amo and 860% phantom interest rate\\n\\n5  the debt service will be approx $874000/year\\n\\n6  given the debt of $8868000 the borrower will be required to provide\\nequity of $2956000 consisting of the following:\\n\\n

suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors \"in smoke filled rooms\" if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers  never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap  i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert  although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\\n\\nprice caps are almost never the right answer\\nprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\\ncompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\\nany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptable\\neight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california\\'s problems to the west\\n\\nthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it\\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position  of course hebert is just one commissioner out of 3 currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda  hope this info helps  ray\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nphillip k

ready to defend your answer  only a number is\\nallowed not an algebraic equation\\n\\nacquiring a company\\n\\n     in the following exercise you will represent company a (the acquirer)\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring company t (the target) by means of\\na tender offer  you plan to tender in cash for 100% of company t\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer  the main complication is this:\\nthe value of company t depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking  indeed the very\\nviability\\nof company t depends on the exploration outcome  if the project fails the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share  but if\\nthe project succeeds the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share  all share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely  by all estimates the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of company a than under current management\\nin fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of a than under\\ncompany t  if the project fails the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement  if the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management the value under company a is $75/share  similarly a\\n$100/share value under company t implies a $150/share value under company\\na\\nand so on\\n\\n     the board of directors of company a has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for company t\\'s shares  this offer must be made now\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known  from all indications\\ncompany t would be happy to be acquired by company a provided it is at a\\nprofitable price  moreover company t wishes to avoid at all cost the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm  you expect company t to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press\\n\\n     thus you (company a) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer but company t will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer  in addition company t will\\naccept any offer by company a that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management  thus if you offer $50/share for\\ninstance company t will accept if the value of the company to company t is\\nanything less than $50\\n\\n     as the representative of company a you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all)

utlity switching and will quietly \\nbuild slower than last year \\n4- therefore by september everyone will freak out\\n5- after the october contract expires (ho)  everyone will realize (similar \\nto ng) that the world will not end\\n\\nwhere does this get us:\\n1- sell q3 hu crack and by q4ho crack (by the time q3 prices out--the wind \\nwill have been taken out of hu sails - plus you can do it

key points:\\n> 1 natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit march at\\n> roughly 700-800 bcf compared with just over 1000 bcf last year at the\\n> end of the traditional withdrawal season\\n> 2 meanwhile domestic natural gas production should rise 30-50% this\\n> year largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency or\\n> production added per rig\\n> 3 nonetheless under most scenarios incorporating numerous other\\n> variables such as the pace of economic expansion fuel switching and\\n> industrial plant closures it appears that storage levels at the beginning\\n> of winter will be near or below last year\\'s 2800 bcf level\\n> 4 thus it appears likely that the \"heat\" will remain on natural gas\\n> prices throughout 2001\\n> 5 consequently we believe that many e&p shares will post solid gains\\n> again this year spurred largely by mounting confidence in the\\n> sustainability of strong natural gas prices\\n>\\n>\\n\\n - 2001 natural gas

difficulty backtesting larry may\\'s var   it looks as if during \\nthe month of june the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into erms but \\nassigned multiple master deal id\\'s  (the code is \"ng-opt-xl-prc\")\\nfor example larry may is showing the following during the month of june: \\njune 1st  $797 million dollars loss\\njune 2nd +192 million dollars made\\njune 5th $300 million dollars made (etc)\\n\\nthis problem makes it impossible to backtest\\n\\nsecond regarding a different approach the immediate solution was the \\nallocation of an additional $5 million dollars of var

aug 8 (reuters) - the head of the largest yet internet\\nexchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity\\nwith transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity\\n   the intercontinentalexchange (ice) an atlanta-based venture\\ninitiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch august\\n24 for trade in precious metals swaps with energy products trade to go\\nlive soon afterwards\\n   while market transparency will increase as dealers used to\\nover-the-counter (otc) telephone-based market trade on a screen users\\nof the ice will remain nameless up until the point of trade jeffrey\\nsprecher ice\\'s chief executive officer told reuters in an interview\\n   \"as soon as you hit the deal the system reveals both\\ncounterparties\" he said \"the real strength is that you (still) get the\\nability to manage your own counterparties\\n   \"you can list all of the people you want to do business with and put\\nin the credit terms under which you will do business\"\\n   this information will then be processed by what sprecher called a\\n\"giant matrix\" within the system\\n   \"(at the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren\\'t sure\\nthey have ever seen the entire market\" he said\\n   \"(on the ice) deals you can do will appear in white and deals you\\ncan\\'t do will be in grey but you can see the entire market\"\\n   giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently\\naware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market\\ntransparency as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who\\nfall outside their own trading criteria sprecher said\\n   the exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock\\nand will be accessible via the public internet or a private network\\nconnection\\n   initial liquidity will be provided by founder members bp amoco\\n<bpal> deutsche bank <dbkgnde> goldman sachs <gsn> morgan stanley\\ndean witter <mwdn> royal dutch/shell <rdas><shell> societe generale\\n<sognpa> and totalfinaelf <totfpa>\\n   shell runs the industry\\'s largest international oil trading operation\\nand goldman sachs\\' jaron commodities arm last year was dominant\\ninternationally in unregulated otc oil derivatives\\n   late in july the original cast was joined by six gas and power\\ncompanies american electric power <aepn> utilicorp\\'s aaquila energy\\n<ucun> duke energy <dukn> el paso energy <epgn> reliant energy\\n<rein> and southern company energy marketing <son>\\n   sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that\\nthe founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will\\nface additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to\\ntrade a minimum volume\\n\\n   traders still to do own clearing\\n   as well as increasing awareness of market moves sprecher believes\\ntrading over the internet could boost trading profits\\n\"the economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a\\npaperless back office can really save a lot of money\" he said\\n   however such savings on trading the ice appear some way off given\\nthat dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing\\nsystems as they do in current otc systems\\n   under the ice once a deal has been struck both counterparties will\\nreceive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those\\nplayers\\' own risk management systems\\n   but the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own\\nclearing system\\n  \"no one really knows how at the moment\" sprecher said \"there might\\nbe some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists\\npeer to peer\"\\n  in terms of participation costs no membership fees will be incurred\\nexcept those associated with trading membership is open to any\\ncommercial market participant\\n   each product will have its own published commission schedule which\\nsprecher assessed at \"slightly below the best prices someone would pay\\nin the voice broker business\"  ((london newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)\\n\\nfor related news double click on one of the following codes:\\n[o] [e]

\\nsubject: ena fileplan project\\n\\nina here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:\\n\\nwe are records and information management consultants from millican & \\nassociates who have been hired by carolyn gilley ena\\'s records manager to \\nformulate a fileplan for all of ena\\'s business records the approach we\\'re \\ntaking to develop this fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each \\nena organization\\'s records now we generally meet with an executive (usually \\na vice president director or manager) within each group to first explain \\nthis project and seek permission to perform the inventory we\\'ll then ask \\nthat executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our \\nworking contact the contact is usually someone who is very familiar with \\ntheir department\\'s record and can be a manager or support staff\\n\\nthere are a number of reasons we are working on this ena fileplan project \\nenron as i am sure you know creates volumes of paper and electronic \\nrecords--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule \\nmany departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention \\nrequirements taking up valuable and expensive office space the fileplan \\nonce completed will document what is being created who has responsibility \\nfor it and how long it must be maintained\\n\\nenron has also invested in a software product called livelink livelink is an \\nimaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it index them and \\nthen use the \"imaged\" document viewable from your computer as the working \\ncopy after scanning the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to \\noffsite storage depending upon its retention requirements \\n\\nduring our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic \\nrecords we\\'ll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses ie \\nmsa sap etc the inventory itself is painless and non-invasive in that we \\ndo not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers it\\'s simply an \\ninterview process where the contact answers a few easy simple questions\\n\\n if you have any additional questions please feel free to give me a call  \\nthank you\\n\\nsara bolken\\nx35150\\n\\n\\n', 'form'], ['john.arnold@enron.com', 'mike.maggi@enron.com', '---------------------- forwarded by john arnold/hou/ect on

has that chance in feb  saw \\nutilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting \\nany extra demand through spot market  in effect they said we're not \\nwithdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage  they had to encourage \\nmarketers to sell it to them so cash was extremely strong in periods of even \\nnormal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather

the following problem very carefully and write in a number at\\nthe end  you should be ready to defend your answer  only a number is\\nallowed not an algebraic equation\\n\\nacquiring a company\\n\\n     in the following exercise you will represent company a (the acquirer)\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring company t (the target) by means of\\na tender offer  you plan to tender in cash for 100% of company t\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer  the main complication is this:\\nthe value of company t depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking  indeed the very\\nviability\\nof company t depends on the exploration outcome  if the project fails the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share  but if\\nthe project succeeds the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share  all share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely  by all estimates the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of company a than under current management\\nin fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of a than under\\ncompany t  if the project fails the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement  if the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management the value under company a is $75/share  similarly a\\n$100/share value under company t implies a $150/share value under company\\na\\nand so on\\n\\n     the board of directors of company a has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for company t\\'s shares  this offer must be made now\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known  from all indications\\ncompany t would be happy to be acquired by company a provided it is at a\\nprofitable price  moreover company t wishes to avoid at all cost the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm  you expect company t to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press\\n\\n     thus you (company a) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer but company t will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer  in addition company t will\\naccept any offer by company a that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management  thus if you offer $50/share

the protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission\\nof six\\ngases co2 among them that are slowly--actually quickly in geological\\nterms--turning the earth into a hothouse but no final accord was\\nreached\\n\\nin this context murphy\\'s purchase of options on 210000 metric tons of\\ncarbon\\n(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27800 cars) from a\\ncanadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target\\nseems a\\nbit odd the market for this kind of trade hasn\\'t been established and\\nthere isn\\'t\\neven a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued indeed\\nthere\\nisn\\'t even unanimity on global warming itself\\n\\nyet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an\\nenvironmental\\ntransition congress may have snubbed the kyoto accord and global\\nbureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions\\ntrading\\nsystem but corporations against the run of play are beginning to\\nconfront the\\nclimate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity\\njohn browne ceo of bp amoco and mark moody-stuart chairman of royal\\ndutch/shell group have both responded to the global-warming threat and\\nset up\\ninternal systems that exceed goals put forth in kyoto shell and bp have\\nvowed\\nto cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the kyoto\\ntarget--shell by 2002 bp by 2010 \"this isn\\'t an act of altruism\" says\\naidan\\nmurphy of shell \"it\\'s a fundamental strategic issue for our business\"\\n\\nand not theirs alone a

\"there\\'s\\nbeen a\\nshift in the center of gravity in the us corporate community since\\nkyoto\" says\\nalden meyer of the union of concerned scientists \"now the view is that\\nclimate\\nchange is serious and we ought to do something about it\"\\n\\nthere are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources\\nand \"cap\\nand trade\" emissions that is set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas\\nemission\\nand let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their\\nallowance or\\nbuy credits if they exceed permitted levels the theory is that the\\npursuit of\\ngreenbacks will fuel greener business \"whenever you turn a pollution\\ncut into a\\nfinancial asset\" says joseph goffman an attorney at environmental\\ndefense\\n\"people go out and make lots of pollution cuts\"\\n\\neven where green fervor is of a paler shade corporations are viewing\\nthe\\npotential for global regulation as a business risk they need to\\nconsider witness\\nclaiborne

question yet that\\'s analogous\\nto the\\none businesses are struggling with on a massive scale until they figure\\nit out\\ncompanies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how\\nyou\\nbuy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)\\nhow to do\\nso when no nation currently assigns a co2 property right \"it\\'s risky as\\nhell\" says\\ndeming\\n\\nmany groups are working to mitigate that risk the world resources\\ninstitute\\nand others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky\\nby\\ncreating universal carbon-accounting practices and four\\ncompanies--arthur\\nandersen credit lyonnais natsource and swiss re--are developing an\\nexchange\\nwhere companies can trade even in an embryonic market devoid of\\nlegislative\\nstandards \"they\\'re trying to nail down something that will be useful\\nunder laws\\nthat are not yet defined\" says garth edward a broker at natsource an\\nenergy-trading firm\\n\\nthe us struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the kyoto\\nprotocol\\nand achieved it by agreeing to a tough many say impossible target:\\nbringing\\nemissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012 the irony of the\\ncurrent\\nsituation is that the europeans reluctant to accept trading at first\\nhave become\\nits champion; britain next month will become the first country to embark\\non a\\nnational trading system\\n\\nanother practice still hotly debated is to assign credits for\\nsequestering carbon\\nin growing forests trees soak up limited amounts of co2 release oxygen\\ninto the\\nair and turn carbon into wood\\n\\nthe kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification thus\\nsetting up\\nan early environmental test for president bush who campaigned against\\nthe\\ndocument but secretary of state colin powell has already heard\\npreliminary\\nbriefings on the matter as the us preps for the next round of talks\\nto be held in\\nbonn in

(the target) by means of\\na tender offer  you plan to tender in cash for 100% of company t\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer  the main complication is this:\\nthe value of company t depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking  indeed the very\\nviability\\nof company t depends on the exploration outcome  if the project fails the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share  but if\\nthe project succeeds the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share  all share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely  by all estimates the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of company a than under current management\\nin fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of a than under\\ncompany t  if the project fails the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement  if the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management the value under company a is $75/share  similarly a\\n$100/share value under company t implies a $150/share value under company\\na\\nand so on\\n\\n     the board of directors of company a has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for company t\\'s shares  this offer

mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do  the \\nquestion is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of \\ncorrecting for violations of the black scholes model  in my mind there are \\nthree big reasons for skew  one is that the assumption of stochastic \\nvolatility as a function of price level gets violated  commodities tend to \\nhave long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and \\nelasticity of the demand curve  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when \\nwe are in that historical pricing environment  however moving to a \\ndifferent pricing regime tends to bring volatility  an options trader wants \\nto be long vol outside the trading range believing that a breakout of the \\nrange leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium  supports a \\nvol smile theory  in addition in some commodities realized vol is a \\nfunction of price level  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at \\n$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3  thus there has been a tendency for all \\ncalls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative \\nskew  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off \\nin a declining market and increase in a rising market  to test regress 15 \\nday realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation  \\nsecond reason is heptocurtosis fatter tails than lognormal distribution \\npredicts  supports vol smile theory  easy to test how your market compares \\nby plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected \\ndistribution  \\nthird is just supply and demand  in a market where spec players are \\nbearish put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance \\npremium to add incremetal risk to the book  if you have a neutral view \\ntowards market or believe that market will come off but in an orderly \\nfashion enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more \\nexpensive insurance  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak \\ncall skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer \\nfences  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of

key points:\\n> 1 natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit march at\\n> roughly 700-800 bcf compared with just over 1000 bcf last year at the\\n> end of the traditional withdrawal season\\n> 2 meanwhile domestic natural gas production should rise 30-50% this\\n> year largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency or\\n> production added per rig\\n> 3 nonetheless under most scenarios incorporating numerous other\\n> variables such as the pace of economic expansion fuel switching and\\n> industrial plant closures it appears that storage levels at the beginning\\n> of winter will be near or below last year\\'s 2800 bcf level\\n> 4 thus it appears likely that the \"heat\" will remain on natural gas\\n> prices throughout 2001\\n> 5 consequently we believe that many e&p shares will post solid gains\\n> again this year spurred largely by mounting confidence in the\\n> sustainability of strong natural gas prices\\n>\\n>\\n\\n - 2001 natural gas

carefully and write in a number at\\nthe end  you should be ready to defend your answer  only a number is\\nallowed not an algebraic equation\\n\\nacquiring a company\\n\\n     in the following exercise you will represent company a (the acquirer)\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring company t (the target) by means of\\na tender offer  you plan to tender in cash for 100% of company t\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer  the main complication is this:\\nthe value of company t depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking  indeed the very\\nviability\\nof company t depends on the exploration outcome  if the project fails the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share  but if\\nthe project succeeds the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share  all share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely  by all estimates the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of company a than under current management\\nin fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of a than under\\ncompany t  if the project fails the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement  if the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management the value under company a is $75/share  similarly a\\n$100/share value under company t implies a $150/share value under company\\na\\nand so on\\n\\n     the board of directors of company a has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for company t\\'s shares  this offer must be made now\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known  from all indications\\ncompany t would be happy to be acquired by company a provided it is at a\\nprofitable price  moreover company t wishes to avoid at all cost the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm  you expect company t to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press\\n\\n     thus you (company a) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer but company t will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer  in addition company t will\\naccept any offer by company a that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management  thus if you offer $50/share for\\ninstance company t will accept if the value of the company to company t is\\nanything less than $50\\n\\n     as the representative of company a you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share  what price offer per share would you tender for company t\\'s\\nstock\\n\\n     $______ per/share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'new'],

a little craziness  my point\\non v/x is that forward spreads months 3/4 and back don't necessarily\\ntrade on value they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes\\nequilibrium between hedging and spec demand  look at k/m do you think k\\ncash will average 3 cents above m  i don't really see that scenario  yet\\nthat's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get\\nthere k/m=3  the same argument applies to v/x  i think this summer will\\nbe exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last\\nyear  but cal 2 will lag the move  it's the main thing customers are\\nselling right now because every equity analyst and even pira are telling\\ntheir customers that cal 2 will average 350  so either the v/x and x/z\\nspreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out  after this winter who in there\\nright mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again  my thought is that the primary\\njuice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure  i'm a\\nseller at 9 and buyer at 5-6  not much in it either way though\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nslafontaine@globalpcom on 01/31/2001 04:47:22 pm\\n\\nto:   johnarnold@enroncom\\ncc:\\nsubject:  re: v/x\\n\\n\\n\\nyou got me wrong-i

columbia river dams then it saw a better\\ndeal with california desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\\nunheard-of peaks kaiser shut down its two us smelters last week it is\\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\\npays bonneville under long-standing contracts\\nit is a measure of this winter\\'s fuel crunch: some big industrial firms in\\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even\\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products the shifts by such large\\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter but they\\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year shortages of aluminum\\nand fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to\\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said\\n\"the fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don\\'t know\\nwhat they\\'re going to use to grow crops with\" said david wyss chief\\neconomist at standard & poor\\'s some economists have recently increased\\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter\\'s heating bills on\\nan already weakening economy goldman sachs analysts last week estimated\\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1000 for a\\ntypical us household\\nthat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\\nenergy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected\\ngrowth in the nation\\'s economic output by one percentage point on an annual\\nrate in the first three months of next year \"overall the recent energy\\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\\nslowdown\" the goldman sachs report concluded terra industries inc in\\nsioux city iowa has closed three of its six us ammonia plants which use\\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production like kaiser the\\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\\ndecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices\\nwhich are much higher than the price terra was obligated to pay under its\\nexisting december supply contract said mark rosenbury chief administrative\\nofficer\\n\"we looked at these [current] prices and said \\'this is crazy\\' \" he said\\nterra hasn\\'t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but\\nrosenbury said it would be \"substantial\"  in coming months terra\\'s good\\nfortune could be reversed it usually buys gas a month at a time and the\\nprices for january delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\\npoint that would keep terra\\'s plants closed rosenbury said but eliminate\\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit \"if this persists\"\\nrosenbury said \"it\\'s going to be a real problem\"\\nhe estimates that out of a total annual us production capacity of 18\\nmillion tons of ammonia about 4 million tons of production isn\\'t operating\\nnow \"could we be short of fertilizer next spring it\\'s possible that\\nfarmers will not have as much as they want\" rosenbury said royster-clark\\ninc a norfolk and new york city-based fertilizer manufacturer and\\ndistributor has shut down its one plant in east dubuque ill\\nindefinitely and 72 production workers will be laid off beginning next\\nmonth the story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\\ncontinued production \"we believe it\\'s likely this is a speculative bubble\\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we\\'ll be able to\\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen\" said paul\\nm murphy the company\\'s managing director for financial planning a\\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers\\' decisions to\\nplant feed corn he said \"it\\'s sticker shock\"\\naccording to wyss if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002 in the\\naluminum industry several smaller producers have joined kaiser the\\nindustry\\'s no 2 manufacturer in closing down noted lloyd o\\'carroll an\\nanalyst with bb&t capital markets in richmond\\naluminum production in november was 83 percent below that of november 1999\\nand december\\'s production will be lower still he said \"we\\'ll get more\\nproduction cut announcements i think\" he said a slowing in the us and\\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\\nsupplies \"but if the world economy doesn\\'t fall completely apart then\\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more\\nthan the current forecast\" he said in kaiser\\'s case it\\'s an open question\\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep kaiser is contractually\\nentitled to buy electricity from bonneville at $2250 a megawatt per hour\\nsays spokesman scott lamb that is the power it has sold back to bonneville\\nfor $550 a megawatt hour for december\\nbut the bonneville authority is pressuring kaiser to use these and future\\nprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants\\nto invest in new electric generating capacity or even to refund to\\nbonneville\\'s other customers said bonneville spokesman ed mosey kaiser and\\nbonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after\\nnext october but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries\\nto kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits \"out\\nhere a deal is a deal but it has to be a moral deal there has to be an\\nethical dimension to this and we\\'re not shy in trying to make sure they live\\nup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power\" mosey\\nsaid\\n 2000 the washington post

unclear cuz it requires\\npower px also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient\\nweather of course but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in\\njuly-shud be marginal in apr-jun\\n   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-46 demand destruction is\\nimplied but im including a factor for r/c energy conservation-ie poor guys \\nlike\\nme turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be\\nless factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will\\nbe closer to 5 bcf apr-jun if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think\\nwe'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner\\n     now rember the 74 is vs gas at sub 600 ie february which is approx \\nwhere\\nwe are today\\n    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider\\nextraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured\\nbefore-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie\\nliquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel some\\nammonia/fert prod  has come back as well but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d\\nindustrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha\\nunction of an economic slowdown\\n    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your \\nbig\\nfund customers(ospraie) we'll see  is collins bullish as well-he seems \\nquieter\\nin the mkt lately\\n  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is\\non a weekly basis we sud test itin other words if the max is say 105 then\\nmeans the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and\\nbe unable to inject all the gas available thots\\n    also you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct\\ndiscount lately daily vs next month futs why not 5 or 30 cts i dont get it \\nbt\\nwondering if its transportation or storage cost

behr\\nwashington post staff writer\\nthursday december 21 2000; page e01\\nkaiser aluminum corp had planned to spend december making aluminum at its\\ngiant smelters in the pacific northwest run by electricity from the\\nbonneville power administration\\'s columbia river dams then it saw a better\\ndeal with california desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\\nunheard-of peaks kaiser shut down its two us smelters last week it is\\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\\npays bonneville under long-standing contracts\\nit is a measure of this winter\\'s fuel crunch: some big industrial firms in\\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even\\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products the shifts by such large\\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter but they\\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year shortages of aluminum\\nand fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to\\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said\\n\"the fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don\\'t know\\nwhat they\\'re going to use to grow crops with\" said david wyss chief\\neconomist at standard & poor\\'s some economists have recently increased\\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter\\'s heating bills on\\nan already weakening economy goldman sachs analysts last week estimated\\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1000 for a\\ntypical us household\\nthat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\\nenergy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected\\ngrowth in the nation\\'s economic output by one percentage point on an annual\\nrate in the first three months of next year \"overall the recent energy\\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\\nslowdown\" the goldman sachs report concluded terra industries inc in\\nsioux city iowa has closed three of its six us ammonia plants which use\\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production like kaiser the\\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\\ndecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices\\nwhich are much higher than the price terra was obligated to pay under its\\nexisting december supply contract said mark rosenbury chief administrative\\nofficer\\n\"we looked at these [current] prices and said \\'this is crazy\\' \" he said\\nterra hasn\\'t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but\\nrosenbury said it would be \"substantial\"  in coming months terra\\'s good\\nfortune could be reversed it usually buys gas a month at a time and the\\nprices for january delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\\npoint that would keep terra\\'s plants closed rosenbury said but eliminate\\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit \"if this persists\"\\nrosenbury said \"it\\'s going to be a real problem\"\\nhe estimates that out of a total annual us production capacity of 18\\nmillion tons of ammonia about 4 million tons of production isn\\'t operating\\nnow \"could we be short of fertilizer next spring it\\'s possible that\\nfarmers will not have as much as they want\" rosenbury said royster-clark\\ninc a norfolk and new york city-based fertilizer manufacturer and\\ndistributor has shut down its one plant in east dubuque ill\\nindefinitely and 72 production workers will be laid off beginning next\\nmonth the story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\\ncontinued production \"we believe it\\'s likely this is a speculative bubble\\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we\\'ll be able to\\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen\" said paul\\nm murphy the company\\'s managing director for financial planning a\\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers\\' decisions to\\nplant feed corn he said \"it\\'s sticker shock\"\\naccording to wyss if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002 in the\\naluminum industry several smaller producers have joined kaiser the\\nindustry\\'s no 2 manufacturer in closing down noted lloyd o\\'carroll an\\nanalyst with bb&t capital markets in richmond\\naluminum production in november was 83 percent below that of november 1999\\nand december\\'s production will be lower still he said \"we\\'ll get more\\nproduction cut announcements i think\" he said a slowing in the us and\\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\\nsupplies \"but if the world economy doesn\\'t fall completely apart then\\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more\\nthan the current forecast\" he said in kaiser\\'s case it\\'s an open question\\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep kaiser is contractually\\nentitled to

a single heavily regulated power \\ncompany to produce transmit and distribute electricity \\'\\'it may be one \\nindustry in which it works reasonably well\\'\\' \\nmr kahn\\'s comments might sound a little heretical when this former carter \\nadministration official was pushing deregulation it was still a novel and \\npolitically risky concept today getting government out of most businesses \\nis part of the washington economic canon \\nmoreover few people believe that california the first state to overhaul its \\nelectricity sector from top to bottom has proved a good laboratory to \\nsatisfy

kahn\\'s remains hopeful \\nthat the kinks can be ironed out \\nin new england and the the middle atlantic states as well in as britain \\nchile and argentina all places that have restructured electricity markets \\nregulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws they have found \\nways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and \\ncharge high prices mr joskow said \\nregulators have also had to establish new markets that through price \\nsignals encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so \\nthat they have reserves for peak hours during peak hours shortages and \\nprice spikes can substantially raise average prices \\n\\'\\'if they can do it in britain chile and argentina then i think we can do \\nit here\\'\\' mr joskow

the mid-1970\\'s he headed the new \\nyork public service commission which oversaw electricity and other regulated \\nindustries the drawbacks were legendary local utilities had an endemic \\ntendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants for which \\nconsumers paid through steady rate increases nearly everyone assumed that \\ncompetition would slash prices \\nbut though free markets do a better job managing rail phone and airline \\nprices they have yet to match regulators\\' ability to juggle the complexities \\nof electricity mr kahn said \\nregulators tended to apply heavy

california \\npolicymakers for deregulating the state\\'s electricity market in such a \\nham-fisted way that power giants like enron cleaned up by exploiting \\nloopholes in the system \\nbut enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process \\n\"enron and ken lay were one of the major players behind the push for \\nderegulation in california\" said janee briesemeister senior policy analyst \\nin the austin office of consumers union \"a lot of what\\'s happening in \\ncalifornia was their idea\" \\nthose familiar with the state\\'s deregulation efforts said enron was \\nespecially eager to ensure that a newly created power exchange where \\nwholesale power would be bought and sold was separate from the independent \\nsystem operator which would oversee the electricity grid \\n\"this fragmented the wholesale market making it harder to monitor\" said \\njohn rozsa an aide to state sen steve peace d-el cajon widely regarded as \\nthe godfather of california\\'s bungled deregulation measures \\n\"enron isn\\'t in the business of making markets work\" rozsa said \"they\\'re in \\nthe business of making a buck\" \\nin an ironic twist however enron now could play a pivotal role in helping \\nthe state remedy past errors and find its energy footing the company has \\nthat much clout \\nseeking lay\\'s blessing \\nthus as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission \\nlines of california\\'s cash-strapped utilities he didn\\'t hesitate to call \\nrecently seeking lay\\'s personal blessing for the plan \\nthis must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had \\nbeen castigated by davis in the governor\\'s state of the state speech \\n\"i told him we couldn\\'t support it\" lay said a hint of a smile playing \\nacross his lips \"it will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid \\nand longer term it could make things worse\" \\nwhy would davis swallow his pride and court favor with enron\\'s big cheese \\nsimple: davis will need the bush administration\\'s backing to make the \\npower-line sale fly and many believe there\\'s no faster way to reach the \\nnew president than via the houston office of his leading corporate patron \\nlay 58 and his company have donated more than $500000 to bush\\'s various \\npolitical campaigns in recent years and he placed enron\\'s private

sees things differently at the mere mention of his close \\nrapport with the president his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited \\nthe words he has repeated numerous times in recent months \\n\"i have known the president and his family for many years\" lay said \"i\\'ve \\nbeen a strong supporter of his i believe in him and i believe in his \\npolicies\" \\nhe insisted that reports of his having sway over bush on energy matters are \\n\"grossly exaggerated\" \\nstill it is striking that bush\\'s quick decision after taking office to limit \\nfederal assistance in solving california\\'s energy woes virtually mirrored \\nlay\\'s own thoughts on the situation so too with the administration\\'s \\nhands-off approach to resolving the crisis \\nwhatever else california\\'s power woes have been very kind to enron\\'s bottom \\nline the company\\'s revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year \\nthey haven\\'t hurt lay either according to company records his pay package \\nmore than tripled last year to $183 million \\nlay and other enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company\\'s \\ncalifornia earnings from other worldwide business activities but lay \\nconceded that enron\\'s profit from california energy deals last year was \"not \\ninconsequential\" \\n\"we benefit from the volatility\" he said \\ncaptive marketplace \\nthat\\'s putting it mildly it could be said that california\\'s energy mess was \\ntailor-made for enron which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a \\ncaptive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are \\nsimultaneously soaring skyward \\nto understand why that is one must look closely at enron\\'s complex business \\nmodel the company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy \\ndeals \\nlay with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy \\nregulator set about completely reinventing enron in 1985 after taking over \\nwhat was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator \\nas he saw it the real action was not in distribution or generation of \\nenergy but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas \\nis needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time \\nenron is now the leader in this fast-growing field and uses that advantage \\nto consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers \\nand sellers throughout the country \\nit also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually \\ncreative deals for example if electricity prices are down but natural gas \\nprices up enron might cut a deal to meet a utility\\'s power needs in return \\nfor taking possession of the gas required to run the utility\\'s plants \\nenron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere using part of the \\nproceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider which it \\nships back to the original utility \\n\"we do best in competitive markets\" lay said \"these are sustainable \\nmarkets\" \\ntrading frenzy \\nenron\\'s trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly \\nyoung mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of \\nthe best deals rock music blares from speakers giving the scene an almost \\nfrat-party atmosphere \\nthe company\\'s trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an \\ninternet-based bidding system which logged 548000 trades valued at $336 \\nbillion making enron by far the world\\'s single biggest e-commerce entity \\nkevin presto who oversees enron\\'s east coast power trades called up the \\ncalifornia electricity market on his computer with a few quick mouse clicks \\nhe showed that enron at that moment was buying power in the golden state at \\n$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275 \\n\"some days we\\'re at $250 some days $300 and some days $500\" presto said \\nover the steady thump-thump of the trading floor\\'s rock \\'n\\' roll soundtrack \\n\"there\\'s truly a problem out there\" \\nthis is a recurring theme among enron officials: california\\'s electricity \\nmarket is broken and enron would prefer it if things just settled down as \\nlay himself put it \"the worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace\" \\nin reality california\\'s dysfunctional marketplace means enron isn\\'t just \\nmaking piles of money it\\'s seeing profits both coming and going \\nlots of business in california \\nthe company\\'s energy services division which handles the complete energy \\nneeds of large institutions counts among its clients the university of \\ncalifornia and california state school systems oakland\\'s clorox co and \\neven the san francisco giants and pac bell park \\nenron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from pacific gas and \\nelectric co which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market \\nvalues at the same time enron sells power to pg&e at sky-high wholesale \\nlevels \\nin other words enron is buying back its own electricity from pg&e for just a \\nfraction of the price it charges the utility \\n\"these guys are the pariahs of the power system\" said nettie hoge executive \\ndirector of the utility reform network in san francisco \"why do we need \\nmiddlemen they don\\'t do anything except mark up the cost\" \\nto be fair energy marketers such as enron can help stabilize an efficient \\nmarketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers \\nthis has proven the case in pennsylvania where enron actively trades among \\nabout 200 market participants \\nbut in an inefficient market such as california a company like enron can \\neasily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state\\'s ill-conceived \\nregulatory framework \\nsylvester turner a houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state \\ncommittee that oversees texas utilities said he can\\'t blame enron and other \\npower companies for pursuing profits in california \\n\"california set up some bad rules and these companies played by the rules \\ncalifornia set up\" he said \"at the end of the day they will behave to \\nenhance their bottom lines\" \\nbut as texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next \\nyear turner said he has learned from california\\'s experience -- and is \\ntaking steps to prevent texas\\' power giants from shaking down local \\nconsumers \\nlessons from golden state \\nhe has written a bill intended to give the texas public utility commission \\nmore authority in cracking down on market abuses the power companies are \\nfighting the legislation as hard as they can \\nnot least among turner\\'s worries is that texas will see what california \\nofficials believe happened in their state: a deliberate withholding of power \\nby leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher \\n\"i have that concern\" he said \"i don\\'t necessarily take these companies at \\ntheir word\" \\nfor his part lay insists that enron has never deliberately manipulated \\nelectricity prices \\n\"i don\\'t know of any of that\" he said \"it\\'s so easy to conjure up \\nconspiracy theories\" \\nas a sign of enron\\'s commitment to solving california\\'s energy troubles lay \\nsaid he supported davis when the state began negotiating

than just leaving the products on last \\ntrade is mid\\n\\nattached is a suggestion for how such a system might work it builds on \\noffset to last trade functionality\\n\\nthe simplified description is: it tracks two variables: intensity(speed) and \\nbias (buy or sell emphasis)  as intensity increases the spread increases \\nas bias increases the offset increases\\n\\ni\\'ll call later to see what you think of the idea\\n\\ndave\\n\\n \\n\\nprogram criteria\\n\\nthe formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to \\nwork with several criteria/inputs/definitions these might be:\\n\\nintensity (speed) - the average time between transaction attempts regardless \\nof whether they are buys or sells measured as a moving average over the last \\n[intensity factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction \\ntibco messages for the product\\nobviously the lower the intensity calculation the higher the transaction \\nflow therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow\\nintensity factor - the number of transactions to be included in the moving \\naverage intensity calculation a possible value for this might be [4]\\n#buys - the number of buys which have occurred\\n#sells - the number of sells which have occured\\ntransaction count - could be either #buys or #sells (whichever last occured)}\\nbuy offset - the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs\\nsell offset - the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs\\noffset reversion ratio (orr)- the amount by which the buy offset should be \\nreduced if a sell occurs (or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy \\noccurs) a possible value for this might be [03] if the application of the \\norr results in a reduction of less than 1 then the reduction shall be 1\\ntransaction reversion ratio (trr)- the amount by which #buys should be \\nreduced if a sell occurs (or amount #sells should be reduced if a buy \\noccurs) a possible value for this might be [03] if the application of the \\ntrr results in a reduction of less than 1 then the reduction shall be equal \\nto 1\\nspread minimum - the minimum spread value allowed a possible value for this \\nmight be [004]\\nspread maximum - the maximum spread value allowed a possible value for this \\nmight be [050]\\noffset minimum - the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells a \\npossible value for this might be [0]\\noffset maximum -the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells a \\npossible value for this might be [050]\\ninitial offset - the buy and sell offset used when the program is started\\ninitial spread - the spread used when the program is started\\nspread-offset minimum - the minimum amount by which spread must exceed \\noffset prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer a \\npossible value for this might be [001]\\ndead interval - the period of time which must pass before the program will \\nrecalculate the above criteria if no transactions have taken place during \\nthe dead interval a possible value for this might be [240] seconds\\n\\nprogram outputs\\n\\nthe program should output the following variables as a result of combining \\nthe above criteria in a user-defined formula:\\n\\nspread (integer) - as per current stack manager\\noffset (integer) - as per current stack manager\\nsuspension (boolean) - whether or not the product should be suspended \\nnormally \"false\"\\n\\n\\nprogram interface and operation principles\\n\\nthe user should be provided with a gui which will allow them to define a \\nrelationship among the above criteria which will produce and apply the \\noutputs to a particular product this relationship would be defined with \\nintensity formulas and transaction formulas \\n\\nevery time a transaction occurs or a dead interval passes the criteria will \\nbe recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the \\nprogram if a dead interval passes without any transactions taking place \\nthen intensity = intensity +240 and #buys=#buys-trr and #sells=#sells-trr and \\nbuy offset = buy offset- orr and sell offset = sell offset - orr \\n\\nif the user-defined formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread \\nshould occur then if the offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) \\nor if no trade has occured (during the passing of a dead interval) the \\nsystem shall perform a last trade is mid calculation around the last \\ntransaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new spread \\nvalue\\n\\nany adjustment to the spread shall respect the spread-offset minimum if a \\nreduction in the spread should violate the spread-offset minimum then the \\nbuy offset (or sell offset or both as appropriate) shall be reduced \\naccordingly similarly if the offset is increased by a transaction formula \\nto a level greater than the spread the spread shall be increased to maintain \\nthe spread-offset minimum\\n\\ngui/formulas example:\\n\\nconstants\\nintensity factor: [4]\\ndead interval: [240]\\noffset reversion ratio (orr): [03]\\ntransaction reversion ratio (trr): [03]\\nspread minimum [004]\\nspread maximum [050]\\noffset minimum [0]\\noffset maximum [049]\\nspread-offset minimum [001]\\n\\n         inputs           outputs\\nintensity formula\\nformula # intensity   spread offset  suspension\\ns1  >220   -001 n/a f\\ns2  <30   +001 n/a f\\ns3  <10   +002 n/a f\\n\\ntransaction formula\\nformula # # transactions  spread offset  suspension\\nv1  <4   n/a -001 f\\nv2  >3   n/a

#sells are not intended to be an absolute count but rather \\nare a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently \\noccured\\n\\nin this example all constants and formulae are editable by the user through \\nthe gui\\n\\n\\nsimulation\\n\\nobviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations \\nto prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness however to give some idea of \\nhow the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular \\ndirection please see the attached:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadditional features\\n\\nsystem notifications\\n\\nthere should be two kinds of notifications for the robotrader which will be \\nsimilar to stack manager garbage checks: warning and failure levels for both \\noffset and price the warning levels will trigger a pager message the \\nfailure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be \\nautomatically suspended the price checks will be against prices input by the \\ntrader (not relative price movements but actual price) there should be both \\nmaximum and minimum price checks (eg gas is trading at $550 the \\nnotification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end) \\noffset checks will only be against a maximum value\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndave\\n\\n\\n', 'application'], ['john.arnold@enron.com', 'mike.maggi@enron.com', '---------------------- forwarded by
